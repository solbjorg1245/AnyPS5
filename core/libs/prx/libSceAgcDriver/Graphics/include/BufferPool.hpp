// Released buffer allocations kept for reuse, since creating, binding and mapping one costs tens of
// microseconds and a build makes several. Small requests are served by size class (the next power of
// two), so the many differently sized data and copied-region buffers of consecutive builds hit;
// requests of a MiB and more keep their exact size (the multi-MiB registered-range snapshots repeat
// exactly, and rounding them would waste pinned host memory). Retained allocations are evicted least
// recently used under a byte budget and a slot count, so a burst of small buffers between two large
// builds no longer sweeps the large ones out. Reuse is safe because a Buffer is only released once
// the GPU work using it completed (kept until the batch fence, or after a CommandBatch wait).
// APS5_NO_BUFFER_CLASSES=1 matches exact sizes only, as before; APS5_BUFFER_POOL_SLOTS=64 restores
// the old slot count (the bound applies to each tier below, so twice that many slots in all).
//
// The size classes and the exact-size allocations are retained in two tiers with a budget each:
// the multi-MiB texture scratch buffers that come back from a batch (GPU-direct uploads and
// write-backs of storage images) filled the one budget, so every one returned evicted hundreds of
// the 256-byte copied-region buffers to fit, and those then missed on every build (81869 misses
// and 80850 evictions per run, each a Vulkan create or destroy under the pool mutex, 3.5 s per
// run). APS5_BUFFER_POOL_SHARED=1 keeps one tier as before.
//
// Device-local allocations (the detiler's scratch buffers and the staging shadows of written guest
// buffers, see GuestBufferMemory) are retained in a third tier with a budget of their own, video
// memory instead of pinned host memory: APS5_STAGING_POOL_MIB (default 2048: 512 evicted ~4000 per
// 10 s of gameplay); 0 keeps them in the two host tiers as before.
